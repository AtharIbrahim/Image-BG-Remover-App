# Image Background Remover App

Welcome! I'm excited to share my latest learning experience: an Image Background Remover app built with Flutter. In my role as the developer of this app, I created a tool to help users effortlessly remove the background from images, perfect for photographers, designers, and casual users. The app features a Python-powered background removal script, a gamified Spin Wheel to earn credits, AdMob for monetization, and SharedPreferences for data storage. Users can buy credits, subscribe for unlimited access, or watch ads for free credits. The goal was to provide a seamless and engaging experience while strengthening my skills in Flutter development, backend integration, and app monetization.
